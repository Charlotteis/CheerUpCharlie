==============

This is my first JavaScript Application!
I wanted to play with the Twilio API to see how it works, and use my first API. I also have six Twilio t-shirts so I can actually wear them and not pretend to know what it does anymore.

I chose to use Node.JS to make this thing work as I want to learn as much JS as possible.
Following guides and using the internet; this led me to use Express.js to structure my app. 
I'd say it took me about 6-8 hours accross two days to get this sorted.

What I used:

Kuler for my colours - https://kuler.adobe.com
JavaScript/HTML/CSS - Learn these things here https://codecademy.com
jQuery to change text and images when you send me a text - http://jquery.com/
Twilio Tutorial from Kevin Whinnery - https://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/03/introducing-the-twilio-module-for-node-js.html
Node.js + Node Package Manager - http://nodejs.org/
Twilio NPM Module - https://npmjs.org/package/twilio
Express NPM Module - https://npmjs.org/package/express
ESJ NPM Module - https://npmjs.org/package/ejs
Heroku to deploy my Node Application - Handy Guide here https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs

After I finished my application, I actually found this: http://quest.twilio.com/ a hold-your-hand 'getting started' with Twilio that I could have used!

Want to see a working version and send me something nice?
